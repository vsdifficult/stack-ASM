# stack-ASM

A stack is a data structure that is used to store temporary values ​​in a program. In assembly language, the stack is usually implemented using processor registers and push and pop operations.

In this example, we use the `ebp` register to store a pointer to the current element on the stack. The `inc ebp` operation increments it to add elements to the stack, and the `dec ebp` operation decrements the pointer to pop elements from the stack. The element values ​​are stored in the `stack` array.

This is a simple example of a stack implementation in assembly language. Real programs typically use more complex algorithms and exception handling. If you have specific questions or requirements for the implementation of the stack, please clarify and I will try to help you further.
